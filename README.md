# Stable-Stability-Selection

This repository accompanies the paper, "*On the Selection Stability of Stability Selection and Its Applications*", providing the essential R scripts to reproduce the analyses presented therein.

**Important Notice on Reproducibility**: The results are reproducible when the code is executed on Posit Cloud, as this platform minimises potential system discrepancies. Please note that execution on other systems may lead to variability, particularly in the installation of dependent packages. Certain packages have been observed to fail installation on specific systems, and using Posit Cloud can mitigate such issues ([Project on Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/content/9178855)).

## File Structure and Descriptions

### 1. **Code_of_Figures**
This directory contains the R scripts required for reproducing the figures presented in the paper. Each R file is named according to its corresponding figure in the manuscript for easy reference. For example, `Figure2a.R` contains the code associated with sub-figure (a) of Figure 2. The files `Figure4a.R` and `Figure5a.R` also display variables with selection frequencies greater than 0.5 for the riboflavin and rat microarray datasets, respectively, along with their selection frequencies as presented in the paper.

### 2. **Figures**
This folder includes the generated plots in both `.png` and `.pdf` formats, allowing users to view and utilize the visual representations directly as presented in the manuscript.
